### Yet another Asteroids clone just to mess around with it


Work in progress: https://rahjael.github.io/StarshipBloopers/




- **Current goals:**

- [x] mouse controlled player's ship

- [x] visual effects when thrusters are on

- [x] randomly generated asteroids

- [x] firing mah lazers

- [x] collision detection for destroying stuff

- [ ] more realistic physics adding mass to objects

- [x] destructible asteroids

- [x] visual effects for asteroids destruction

- [ ] HUD with player's hp, energy, shields and stuff like that (TBD)


- **Later on:**

- [ ] have viewport move instead of everything else


- **Maybe:**

- [ ] maps? with static stuff? Maybe destructable static stuff?


- **Wishful thinking:**

- [ ] some enemies with very very VERY basic AI
