# Starship Bloopers

### Yet another asteroids clone just to mess around with it


Work in progress: link


Current goals:

[x] mouse controlled player's ship

[x] visual effects when thrusters are on

[x] randomly generated asteroids

[x] firing mah lazers

[x] collision detection for destroying stuff

[ ] more realistic physics adding mass to objects

[ ] destructible asteroids

[ ] visual effects for asteroids destruction

[ ] HUD with player's hp, energy, shields and stuff like that (TBD)


Later on:

[ ] have viewport move instead of everything else


Maybe:

[ ] maps? with static stuff? Maybe destructable static stuff?


Wishful thinking:

[ ] some enemies with very very VERY basic AI
